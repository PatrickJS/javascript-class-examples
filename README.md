# javascript-class-examples
Different examples of OOP "class" with "inheritance" done using JavaScript including languages that transpile into js. Take notice to the amount of boilerplate that's needed in ES5 compared to ES6. These examples all have the same interface with pros/cons for each pattern. If they seem similar that's whole point especially the difference between prototypal and pseudo-classical.
